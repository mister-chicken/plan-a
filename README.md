## Personal Finance and Portfolio Management Planning

### Overview

The goal of this project is help manage personal and household finances


This means solving for two problems
1. How do to I maximize my saving?
2. How do I put my savings to work to maximize growth? 

#### Maximizing Savings

First I need to understand personal cashflows. 

1. I'll do this by extracting CSV's of my credit card statements under data/raw/
2. Then I'll normalize these CSV's to a single file
3. Then I'll categorize spending by several main categories
    * Rent
    * Utilities
    * Dinning Out
    * Groceries
    * Subway
    * Taxi
    * Shopping
    * Subscriptions
    * home
4. Do basic analytics on how much I'm spending on each category, month by month
5. Set Goals
    * Long term savings
        * house
    * Mid-term savings 
        * trips
        * life
    * short term savings
        * emergency funds
